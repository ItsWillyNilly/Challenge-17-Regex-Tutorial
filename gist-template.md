# William's Regex Tutorial For Matching Valid Dates

Regex or "regular expressions" for short, are a powerful tool used in computer programming for searching, matching, and manipulating text based on specific patterns. They consist of a sequence of characters that define a search pattern, which can be used to find or replace parts of a string, validate inputs, or extract information from text. Regex is widely used in text processing, data validation, and parsing tasks across various programming languages, such as Python, JavaScript, and Perl. Despite its complex syntax, regex is highly versatile and efficient for handling intricate text-based operations. 

## Summary

This regex tutorial will go through and break down the following regex for matching a date in the format ```YYYY-MM-DD```:

```/^(?:(\d{4})-(0[1-9]|1[0-2])-(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01]))$/```

This regex is really useful for form validation where a user is entering a date when submitting a form, data parsing where the the program needs to parse logs, CSV files, or any text where dates are embedded and needed to be validated or extracted. Other contexts include, API input validation, such as providing the dates in the right format before processing their requests and data operations, where dates need to be validated and formatted before they are inserted into the database.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
```^```: The caret anchor tells the reader that the match must start at the beginning of the string. In this regex, the ```^``` ensures the date starts from the first character.

```$```: The dollar sign anchor tells the reader that the match must end at the end of the string. In this regex, the ```$``` ensures that there would be no extra characters after the date.

Together, The ```^``` and the ```$``` anchor work together to ensure that the entire string is matched, not just a substring.

### Quantifiers
```{n}```: This quanitfier specifies that the preceding element (```\d```) must appear exactly 'n' times. 

Therefore, ```\d{4}``` in this regex matches a a four-digit year.

### OR Operator
```|```: Also known as the 'OR' operator, is used to tell the regex to match either the pattern on the right or the pattern on the left.

In this regex, the ```|``` allows the substring ```(0[1-9]|1[0-2])``` to match a month in between ```01 - 09``` or between ```10 - 12```.

### Character Classes
```\d```: This character class matches any digit, equivalent to ```[0-9]```. 

For example, in the pattern ```\d{4}```, it will check if the there are four digits (the year).

### Flags
***Flags*** are optional modifiers that alter the way a regular expression behaves. They are often located after the closing delimiter of the expression.

No flags were used in this regex, which means it is operating in deafult mode (case-sensitive, non-global, single-line, and without Unicode or sticky behavior).

### Grouping and Capturing
```()```: Parentheses are used for capturing grouping parts of the regex. 

The first set of parentheses (```(0[1-9]|1[0-2])```) in this regex, is used to capture a subpattern for matching the months, while the second set of parantheses (```(0[1-9]|[12]\d|3[01])```), is used to capture the days.

### Bracket Expressions
```[]```: Brackets define a *character class*, which matches any one of the characters within the brackets.

In this regex, ```[0-9]``` is used for matching any digit between '0' and '9'. ```[12]``` is used for matching either a '1' or '2'. Finally, ```[0-2]``` is used to match any digit between '0' and '2'.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
***Greedy matches*** try to match as much text as possible. ***Lazy Matches*** try to match as little text as possible.

Lazy matches in this regex are denoted by the ```?``` character, while greedy matches are used implicitly, as we're matching a specific set of digits.

### Boundaries
```\b```: Used to match a word boundary.

```\b``` was not utilized in this regex because the ```^``` and ```$``` anchors already ensure that the full string is matched.

### Back-references
Back-references refer to previously captured groups.

Back-references were not utilized in this regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
***Look-ahead*** (```(?=...)```) attempts to match the given pattern with the subsequent input. ***Look-behind*** on the other hand, attempts to the match the given pattern with the previous input.

Look-ahead and look-behind assertions were not used in this regex because the structure of the date format does not require them.
